# Intrepid - My base theme for Hugo

Intrepid is my base theme for developing websites using [Hugo][hugo]. It uses
the [Bulma][bulma] CSS framework and the [Feather][feather] icon library.

## Very Important note
This is not intended as a theme that you can drop into your own website. It meets
my needs and may not meet yours. If you are looking for a complete theme please
use one of the many awesome themes listed on the [Hugo Themes][hugo2] site.

I am publishing my theme here for two main reasons:

1. It is part of my explorations of Hugo functionality
1. I hope that it may help others in their journey to explore Hugo
